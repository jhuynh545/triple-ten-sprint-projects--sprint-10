# triple-ten-sprint-projects--sprint-10

This project involves analyzing and modeling data related to gold recovery processes. The dataset is provided in three files:

gold_recovery_train.csv: Training dataset.
gold_recovery_test.csv: Test dataset, lacking target values.
gold_recovery_full.csv: Source dataset containing both training and test sets with all features.
Key considerations:

Data is indexed by the date and time of acquisition, with parameters close in time showing similarity.
Some features in the training set are unavailable in the test set, as they were calculated or measured later.
Your task is to verify the correctness of the raw data, preprocess it appropriately, and build a model to analyze the gold recovery process effectively.
